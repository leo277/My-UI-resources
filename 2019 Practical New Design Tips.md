## Light comes from the sky

Elements that are generally inset:
Text input fields
Pressed buttons
Slider tracks
Radio button (unselected)
Checkboxes
Elements that are generally outset:
Buttons (unpressed)
Slider buttons
Dropdown controls
Cards
The button part of a selected radio button
Popups

When using flat design, use shadows as visual cue for interaction

## Black and white first
Designing in grayscale before adding color simplifies the most complex element of visual design– and forces you to focus on spacing and laying out elements.
Add color last, and even then, only with purpose.

Color(Rules):
Use 1/2 hue color scheme
Darker color variation = higher saturation + lower brightness
Lighter Color Variation = lower saturation + higher brightness
