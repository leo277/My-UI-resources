## Light comes from the sky

Elements that are generally inset:
Text input fields
Pressed buttons
Slider tracks
Radio button (unselected)
Checkboxes
Elements that are generally outset:
Buttons (unpressed)
Slider buttons
Dropdown controls
Cards
The button part of a selected radio button
Popups

When using flat design, use shadows as visual cue for interaction

## Black and white first
Designing in grayscale before adding color simplifies the most complex element of visual design– and forces you to focus on spacing and laying out elements.
Add color last, and even then, only with purpose.

>Color(Rules):
>
>Use 1/2 hue color scheme
>
>Darker color variation = higher saturation + lower brightness
>
>Lighter Color Variation = lower saturation + higher brightness
>

## Double your whitespace
Put space between your lines.
Put space between your elements.
Put space between your groups of elements.

## Learn the methods of overlaying text on images
1 Use dark background
Apply white text on top
The image should be dark, and not have a lot of contrast-y edges
Test it at every screen/window size to make sure it’s legible
Now never change the text or the image, and you should be good to go.

If background not dark enough, apply overlay of translucent black

2 Text in a box
Use a small portion of translucent background box on text, on top of image

3 Blur the image
Be careful, make sure the text always appear on top of the blury part

4 Subtle gradient
gradiated-opacity box on the text

## Make text pop — and un-pop
* Size (bigger or smaller)
* Color (greater contrast or lesser; bright colors draw the eye)
* Font weight (bolder or thinner)
* Capitalization (lowercase, UPPERCASE, and Title Case)
* Italicization
* Letter spacing (or— fancy term alert— tracking!)
* Margins (technically not a property of the text itself, but can be used to draw attention, so it makes the list)

Up-pop and down-pop
You can divide all the ways of styling text into two groups:
Styles that increase visibility of the text. Big, bold, capitalized, etc.
Styles that decrease visibility of the text. Small, less contrast, less margin, etc.


Hover/Unhover
* Text color
* Background color
* Shadows
* Underlining
* Slight animations— raising, lowering, etc.

One solid option: try turning white elements colored, or turning colored elements white, but darkening the background behind them.

## Only use good fonts
* Work Sans
* Roboto
* Montserrat
* Source Sans Pro
* Feather Icons
