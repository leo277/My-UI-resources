### Experience Maps
A diagram that explores the multiple steps taken by users as they engage with the product. Experience map allows designers to frame the user’s motivations and needs in each step of the journey, creating design solutions that are appropriate for each.
### Use Cases
A use case is a written description of how users will perform tasks in your app
### Storyboards
### Market Research - Competitive-analysis report
### Design
* Moodboards 
> A collaborative collection of images and references that will eventually evolve into a product’s visual style guide
* Sketches
> Sketching is a quick way of visualizing an idea (e.g. new interface design) by using paper and pen
* Wireframes
> A visual guide that represents the page structure, as well as its hierarchy and key elements.
* Prototypes
> A prototype is a simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch.
### Testing
* Quantitative Survey
> Questions that provide numbers as result (lack of interaction)
* Usability report
> Usability report summarize usability findings in a clear, precise and descriptive way that helps the product team identify the issue(s) and work toward a solution. 
* Analytics report
> Numbers provided by an analytics tool on how the user interacts with your product: clicks, user session time, search queries etc. Analytics report can also “uncover the unexpected”, surfacing behaviors that aren’t explicit in user tests.
